**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then blurred it using Gaussian smoothing to make it easier to detect edges, where the kernel_size is 5. 
After that, I used canny edge detection and masked it.

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by using ransac regression which like a liner regression.
In draw_lines() function,firstly I apply hough transform to edge image with region mask.And then,the points of lines generated by hough transform were classified right and left lanes.After all of points were classified, fit a straight line to each lane by ransac algorithm.

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when car runs on curving road.
This is because I use liner regression as a draw line function. It works well only under premise that road is straight.

Another shortcoming could be what would happen when lane line's color and road's color are almost same.



### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to introduce gradient threshold for draw line function.
This will work when my finding lane line program detect non-lane object as lane and draw line which has outlier gradint.

Another potential improvement could be to use curve fitting.
